    "# Foreword (ReadME)\n",
    "This lecture provides information on how to utilize [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for materials simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use [anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (not miniconda) for linux (most density functional codes need a unix file system). \n",
    "On my laptop, I use [linux as a subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) under windows10 and [ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab) \n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture is heavily based on the **[Atomic Simulation Environment - ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/)**.\n",
    "This package makes it possible to use different density functional codes as calculators, and also to use ASE as a post-processor for an already performed calculation. It is very usefull to switch between differnet codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The density functional theory (DFT) codes are discussed:\n",
    "* [GPAW](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/)\n",
    "* [exciting](http://exciting-code.org/)\n",
    "* [Vasp](https://www.vasp.at/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The molecular dynamix codes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [ASAP](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/asap/asap)\n",
    "* [EMT- MD calculator of SAE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/emt.html#module-ase.calculators.emt)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note, that there is **no programming** required, but the user should not be shy in changing the values of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The philosophy of these notebooks is that **we use optimized packages** instead of rewritting code! Therefore, the programming language python is used that provides a large number of those packages. The packages semselfs are probably running mostly in Fortran and C, but we do not worry about that.\n"
