Materials Simulation Lecture

I gave this guest lecture at the end of Haixuan Xu's (Haixuan Xu) class [MSE 613: Simulation and Modeling in MSE I](https://xhx.utk.edu/teaching/) in Spring 
2019 at [University of Tennessee Knoxville](https://mse.utk.edu/).


Therefore, I expect the reader to know about density functional theory and just introduce here the usage of [jupyter 
notebooks](https://jupyter.org) as an option to interact and compare results from calculations.

Plese note that I am using my pyTEMlib only to visualize crystal structures and to load files. So that package is not strictly necessary.

Have Fun,

Gerd
